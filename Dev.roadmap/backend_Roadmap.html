            <p>
                The Internet is a global network of computers connected to
                each other which communicate through a standardized set of protocols.

            <h2>Learn a Language </h2>
            <p>
                Even if you’re a beginner the least you would have known
                is that Web Development is majorly classified into two facets:
                Frontend Development and Backend Development. And obviously,
                they both have their respective set of tools and technologies.
                For instance, when we talk about Frontend Development, there always
                comes 3 names first and foremost – HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

                In the same way, when it comes to Backend Web Development – we primarily require a
                backend (or you can say server-side) programming language to make the websit
                e function along with various other tools & technologies such as databases, frameworks, web servers,
                etc.

                Pick a languag e from the given list and make sure to learn its quirks, core
                details about its runtime e.g. concurrency, memory model etc.

            <h2> Version Control Systems
            </h2>
            <p>
                Version control/source control systems allow developers to track and
                control changes to code over time. These services often include the a
                bility to make atomic revisions to code, branch/fork off of specific points,
                and to compare versions of code. They are useful in determining the who, what,
                when, and why code changes were made.

            <h2>Repo Hosting Services
            </h2>
            <p>
                When working on a team, you often need a remote place to put your code
                so others can access it, create their own branches, and create or review
                pull requests. These services often include issue tracking, code review
                , and continuous integration features. A few popular choices are GitHub,
                GitLab, BitBucket, and AWS CodeCommit.

            <h2> Relational Databases
            </h2>
            <p>
                A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides
                access to data points that are related to one another. Relational databases
                store data in a series of tables. Interconnections between the tables are
                specified as foreign keys. A foreign key is a unique reference from one row in
                a relational table to another row in a table, which can be the same table but is most commonly a
                different table.

            <h2> APIs</h2>
            <p>API is the acronym for Application
                Programming Interface, which is a software
                intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other.

            <h2> Caching</h2>
            <p>Caching is a technique of storing frequently used data or information in a local memory, for a certain
                time period. So, next time, when the client requests the same information, instead of retrieving the
                information from the database, it will give the information from the local memory. The main advantage of
                caching is that it improves the performance by reducing the processing burden.

            <h2>Web Security Knowledge </h2>

                from threats that could affect the business.

            <h2> Testing</h2>
            <p>A key to building software that meets requirements without defects is testing. Software testing helps
                developers know they are building the right software. When tests are run as part of the development
                process (often with continuous integration tools), they build confidence and prevent regressions in the
                code.

            <p>CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) is the practice of automating building, testing, and
                deployment of applications with the main goal of detecting issues early, and provide quicker releases to
                the production environment.

            <h2>Scaling Databases </h2>
            <p>Scaling databases is the process of adapting them to handle more data and users efficiently. It’s
                achieved by either upgrading existing hardware (vertical scaling) or adding more servers (horizontal
                scaling). Techniques like sharding and replication are key. This ensures databases continue to be a
                robust asset as they grow.

            <h2> Databases</h2>
            <p>A database is a collection of useful data of one or more related organizations structured in a way to
                make data an asset to the organization. A database management system is a software designed to assist in
                maintaining and extracting large collections of data in a timely fashion.

            <h2>Web Servers </h2>
            <p>Web servers can be either hardware or software, or perhaps a combination of the two. </p>

            <H3 style="text-align:left ;">Hardware Side:</H3>
            <P>A hardware web server is a computer that houses web server software and the files that make up a website
                (for example, HTML documents, images, CSS stylesheets, and JavaScript files). A web server establishes a
                connection to the Internet and facilitates the physical data exchange with other web-connected devices.
            </P>
            <H3 style="text-align: left;">Software side:</H3>
            <p>
                A software web server has a number of software components that regulate how hosted files are accessed by
                online users. This is at the very least an HTTP server. Software that knows and understands HTTP and
                URLs (web addresses) is known as an HTTP server (the protocol your browser uses to view webpages). The
                content of these hosted websites is sent to the end user’s device through an HTTP server, which may be
                accessed via the domain names of the websites it holds.

                Basically, an HTTP request is made by a browser anytime it wants a file that is stored on a web server.
                The relevant (hardware) web server receives the request, which is then accepted by the appropriate
                (software) HTTP server, which then locates the requested content and returns it to the browser over
                HTTP. (If the server cannot locate the requested page, it responds with a 404 error.)

            <h2>NoSQL database </h2>
            <p>NoSQL databases offer data storage and retrieval that is modelled differently
                to “traditional” relational databases. NoSQL databases typically focus more
                on horizontal scaling, eventual consistency, speed and flexibility and is used
                commonly for big data and real-time streaming applications. NoSQL is often described
                as a BASE system (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency) as opposed to
                SQL/relational which typically focus on ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).
                Common NoSQL data structures include key-value pair, wide column, graph and document.

            <h2>Building for Scale </h2>
            <p>Speaking in general terms, scalability is the ability of a system to handle a growing amount of work by
                adding resources to it.

                A software that was conceived with a scalable architecture in mind, is a system that will support higher
                workloads without any fundamental changes to it, but don’t be fooled, this isn’t magic. You’ll only get
                so far with smart thinking without adding more sources to it.
