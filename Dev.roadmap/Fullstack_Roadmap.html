            <h2>Node.js
            </h2>
            <p>Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. It is a popular tool for
                almost any kind of project! Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, Google Chrome’s core, outside the
                browser. This allows Node.js to be very performant. A Node.js app runs in a single process, without
                creating a new thread for every request. Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its
                standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking and generally, libraries in Node.js are
                written using non-blocking paradigms, making blocking behavior the exception rather than the norm.

            <h2>Monit </h2>
            <p>When it comes to monitoring the health of your applications, there are several different options
                available. My favorite monitoring stack is Prometheus and Grafana, but it can be a bit overwhelming to
                set up and configure. If you’re looking for a simpler solution, Monit is a great alternative that can be
                utilized to monitor and manage system resources such as services, processes, files, directories,
                devices, and network connections, making your application more reliable and resilient to issues like
                crashes, unresponsiveness, or resource exhaustion.
