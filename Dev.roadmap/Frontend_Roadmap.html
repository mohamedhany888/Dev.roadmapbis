            <h2>Internet </h2>
            <p>The Internet is a global network of computers connected to each other <br>which communicate through a
                standardized set of protocols.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="event-description" style="margin-top: 100px;">
            <h2>HTML</h2>
            <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used on the frontend and
                gives the structure to the webpage which you can style using
                CSS and make interactive using JavaScript.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="event-description" style="margin-top: 100px;">
            <h2>CSS</h2>
            <p>CSS or Cascading Style Sheets is the language used to style the frontend of any website.
                CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="event-description" style="margin-top: 100px;">
            <h2>JavaScript</h2>
            <p>JavaScript allows you to add interactivity to your pages.
                Common examples that you may have seen on the websites are sliders,
                click interactions, popups and so on.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="event-description" style="margin-top: 100px;">
            <h2>Version Control Systems</h2>
            <p>Version control systems allow you to track changes to your codebase/files over time. They allow you to go
                back to some previous version of the codebase without any issues. Also, they help in collaborating with
                people working on the same code – if you’ve ever collaborated with other people on a project, you might
                already know the frustration of copying and merging the changes from someone else into your codebase;
                version control systems allow you to get rid of this issue.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="event-description" style="margin-top: 100px;">
            <h2>Package Managers</h2>
            <p>Package managers allow you to manage the dependencies (external code written by you or someone else) that
                your project needs to work correctly.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="event-description" style="margin-top: 100px;">
            <h2>Pick a Framework</h2>
            <p>Web frameworks are designed to write web applications. Frameworks are collections of libraries that aid
                in the development of a software product or website. Frameworks for web application development are
                collections of various tools. Frameworks vary in their capabilities and functions, depending on the
                tasks set. They define the structure, establish the rules, and provide the development tools required.

        <div class="event-description" style="margin-top: 100px;">
            <h2>Modern CSS</h2>
            <p>The way we write CSS in our modern front-end applications is completely different from how we used to
                write CSS before. There are methods such as Styled Components, CSS Modules, Styled JSX, Emotion, etc</p>
        </div>

        <div class="event-description" style="margin-top: 100px;">
            <h2>CSS Architecture</h2>
            <p>CSS is notoriously difficult to manage in large, complex, rapidly-iterated systems. There are different
                ways of writing CSS that allows in writing more maintainable CSS.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="event-description" style="margin-top: 100px;">
            <h2>CSS Preprocessors</h2>
            <p>CSS Preprocessors are scripting languages that extend the default capabilities of CSS. They enable us to
                use logic in our CSS code, such as variables, nesting, inheritance, mixins, functions, and mathematical
                operations.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="event-description" style="margin-top: 100px;">
            <h2>Build Tools</h2>
            <p>Task runners automatically execute commands and carry out processes behind the scenes. This helps
                automate your workflow by performing mundane, repetitive tasks that you would otherwise waste an
                egregious amount of time repeating yourself.

                Common usages of task runners include numerous development tasks such as: spinning up development
                servers, compiling code (ex. SCSS to CSS), running linters, serving files up from a local port on your
                computer, and many more!

            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="event-description" style="margin-top: 100px;">
            <h2>Testing your apps</h2>
            <p>Before delivering your application to users, you need to be sure that your app meets the requirements it
                was designed for, and that it doesn’t do any weird, unintended things (called ‘bugs’). To accomplish
                this, we ‘test’ our applications in different ways.

            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="event-description" style="margin-top: 100px;">
            <h2>Authentication Strategies</h2>
            <p>Authentication strategies are methods or techniques used to verify the identity of a user or system in
                order to grant access to a protected resource. There are several different authentication strategies
                that can be used, including:

                Basic Authentication
                Session Based Authentication
                Token Based Authentication
                JWT Authentication
                OAuth
                SSO
                You don’t necessarily need to learn all of these, how to implement and the ins and outs from the get go.
                But it’s important to know what they are and how they work. This will help you make better decisions
                when choosing an authentication strategy for your application.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="event-description" style="margin-top: 100px;">
            <h2>Web Security Knowledge</h2>
            <p>Web security refers to the protective measures taken by the developers to protect the web applications
                from threats that could affect the business.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="event-description" style="margin-top: 100px;">
            <h2>Web Components</h2>
            <p>Web Components is a suite of different technologies allowing you to create reusable
                custom elements — with their functionality encapsulated away from the rest of your
                code — and utilize them in your web apps.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="event-description" style="margin-top: 100px;">
            <h2>Type Checkers</h2>
            <p>Type checker helps developers write code with fewer bugs by adding types to their code,
                trying to catch type errors within your code, and then removing them during compile time.
                Flow and TypeScript are two popular static type checkers for JavaScript.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="event-description" style="margin-top: 100px;">
            <h2>Server-side rendering</h2>
            <p>Server-side rendering refers to the process that the service side completes the HTML
                structure splicing of the page, sends it to the browser, and then binds the status and events
                for it to become a fully interactive page.

            </p>
        </div>


        <div class="event-description" style="margin-top: 100px;">
            <h2>Graphql</h2>
            <p>GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries
                with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description
                of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and
                nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.

            </p>
        </div>


        <div class="event-description" style="margin-top: 100px;">
            <h2>Static Site Generators</h2>
            <p>A static site generator is a tool that generates a full static HTML website
                based on raw data and a set of templates. Essentially, a static site generator
                automates the task of coding individual HTML pages and gets those pages ready
                to serve to users ahead of time. Because these HTML pages are pre-built,

                they can load very quickly in users’ browsers.</p>

        <div class="event-description" style="margin-top: 100px;">
            <h2>Progressive Web Apps</h2>
            <p>Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are websites that are progressively
                enhanced to function like installed, native apps on supporting platforms
                , while functioning like regular websites on other browsers.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="event-description" style="margin-top: 100px;">
            <h2>Mobile applications</h2>
            <p>A while back, developing a mobile app using JavaScript was impossible.
                But now JavaScript developers can create mobile applications using their
                knowledge for web development. Here is the list of options to create mobile applications in JavaScript.

                UI / UX Knowledge - Gaining UI/UX knowledge is not a must for a
                Frontend Developer but having an eye for design and a good understanding
                of UI/UX will help you in your career.

                Visual Programming — it is entirely possible to be a successful, competent
                frontend developer without it, but for many frontend developers this path
                represents a serious chunk of their workload, and represents a very in-demand
                option for frontend development – especially for developers who have a visual aptitude.

                Web Graphics Library (WebGL): WebGL MDN, WebGL Fundamentals
                2D Graphics: Canvas, PixiJS, PhaserJS
                3D Graphics: ThreeJS, BabylonJS

                Houdini — Here is a good introductory article to houdini.
                WebRTC - WebRTC is a free, open project that provides browsers and mobile
                applications with Real-Time Communications (RTC) capabilities via simple APIs.
                The WebRTC components have been optimized to best serve this purpose.
                IDLs - Not every developer will have a need for understanding IDLs but there’s
                a good argument for having more JavaScript developers aware of their existence
                and hopefully the ability for making use of them as well.
                WebAssembly - WebAssembly is a comparatively new technology that allows you to
                run code written in languages other than JavaScript on the web. It’s a low-level
                assembly-like language with a compact binary format that runs with near-native
                performance and provides languages such as C/C++ and Rust with a compilation target
                so that they can run on the web.</p>
